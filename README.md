# Blockchain-Based Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence

## Overview

This platform leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof system for cybersecurity threat intelligence sharing and management. By establishing a trusted network for security researchers, organizations, and vendors, the platform enhances collaboration in identifying, verifying, and mitigating security vulnerabilities while providing immutable attribution and accountability throughout the security lifecycle.

## Core Components

### 1. Source Verification Contract
Validates and establishes the credibility of security researchers and threat intelligence providers:
- Identity verification with privacy preservation
- Reputation scoring based on contribution history
- Expertise classification and specialization tagging
- Credential verification without centralized authorities
- Anonymous submission protocols with cryptographic validation
- Cross-platform reputation import/export

### 2. Threat Registration Contract
Creates immutable records of identified vulnerabilities and security threats:
- Standardized vulnerability documentation format
- Zero-day vulnerability secure disclosure process
- Proof of concept validation workflow
- Affected systems and software versioning
- Exploitation technique classification
- Duplicate detection and linking mechanisms
- Responsible disclosure timelock features

### 3. Severity Assessment Contract
Objectively classifies the impact and criticality of security issues:
- Multi-dimensional scoring algorithms (CVSS integration)
- Impact assessment across different security domains
- Exploitability factors and technical complexity evaluation
- Consensus-based severity validation
- Dynamic severity adjustment based on new information
- Industry-specific risk contextualizing

### 4. Mitigation Tracking Contract
Monitors and verifies the resolution process of identified vulnerabilities:
- Patch development tracking
- Verification testing documentation
- Deployment status monitoring
- Effectiveness measurement
- Regression testing results
- Mitigation bypass tracking
- Vendor response time analytics

### 5. Attribution Contract
Securely records evidence and indicators linking threats to specific actors:
- Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) cataloging
- Attack pattern recognition and linking
- Evidence hash storage with confidentiality options
- Multi-source correlation mechanisms
- Confidence scoring for attribution claims
- Counter-attribution protection
- Intelligence community consensus building

## Benefits
